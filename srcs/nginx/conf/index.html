<h1>Welcome to alellouc.42.fr - nginx webpage!</h1>

working. Further configuration is required.</p>
<p class="custom">If you see this page, you can notice that is a custom webpage, only for
demonstrating that I have setting some nginx configs, as connecting to this at
the 443 port, like project inception is expecting us to do</p>
