# Why do I use wordpress like that instead of giving ip ? [fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000;]
# This is about Docker Networking :
# the containers are linked by the docker-compose.yml volumes instruction
# so when they are built and run, Docker will insert into their /etc/hosts an
# entry about each other, like we have to do for aliasing inception inside our
# /etc/hosts (not the containers ones), the entry is made with the service name 
# we had give to container, that is why I can call this alias here: this is the
# alias given into /etc/hosts -> the name of the service That is why
